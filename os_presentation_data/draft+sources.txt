extra notes : 
7. os.path.exists(): This method will check whether a file exists or not by passing the name of the file as a parameter. OS module has a sub-module named PATH by using which we can perform many more functions. 
 
8. os.getsize()

16. os.path.join() :
This method joins various path components with exactly one directory separator (“/”) following each non-empty part except for the last path component. If the last path component is empty then a directory separator (“/”) is put at the end. This method returns a string with the concatenated path.


17. os.path.basename() :
This method is used to get the base name in a specified path. The method returns a string value that represents the base name of the specified path.


18. os.path.split() :
This method splits the pathname into a pair of head and tail. Here, the tail is the last pathname component and the head is everything that comes before it. The method returns a tuple of the head and tail of the specified path.

os module path split
19. os.path.dirname() :
This method returns the directory name from the path given.

 


20. os.path.commonprefix() :
This method returns the longest path prefix which is a prefix for all the paths in the specified list.


21. os.path.getmtime() :
This method returns the time of the last modification of the path.

22. os.path.isfile()
16. os.path.join() :
This method joins various path components with exactly one directory separator (“/”) following each non-empty part except for the last path component. If the last path component is empty then a directory separator (“/”) is put at the end. This method returns a string with the concatenated path.

20. os.path.commonprefix() :
This method returns the longest path prefix which is a prefix for all the paths in the specified list.

os module commonprefix
21. os.path.getmtime() :
This method returns the time of the last modification of the path.

os gettime
22. os.path.getatime() :
This method returns the time of the last access of the path.
